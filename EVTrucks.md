During my studies, I stumbled across an article outlining the global EV outlook for 2019. In this article posted on the International Energy Agency website, 
one of the figures included in the article regarded EV trucks that are currently on the market and also showed those that are soon to arrive. To me, this is
a very interesting topic, as not many of these trucks are on the road yet even though they have the potential to really transform the industry. By changing 
even a fraction of the energy required for ground freight to renewable sources, the world could make a measurable impact to better our environment. The link to the aricle can be found [here](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2019#key-findings).

The original chart (Figure 2.2) within the directory of figures for this article caught my eye immediately. While it is a very interesting topic, the clarity is very poor. The scatter plot is inundated with text, which makes it actually quite difficult to distinguish any trends in the data points themselves. 
Take a look for yourself!

Based on the important message and the lack of clarity in the delivery, I thought that this would be an optimal opportunity to try and re-work the chart. Going through the critique method, my biggest take-away was that the data was really all there but it needed to be trimmed and organized better to be digestible. At the end of the day this chart's problem came down to simple aesthetics. This lack of aesthetic clarity was the root cause of a less engagement and poor perceptability. In order to streamline the data, I opted to trim the power source type and to re-work the brand labels. Having the legend track both power source type (battery, hybrid, fuel cell) as well as product status (in production, customer trial, prototype) led to a very confusing chart because the single legend was describing two completely unrelated categorical variables. In addition, my main goal was to eliminate all of the text labels. These were not only an eye sore, but also detracted from any viewer's ability to recognize trends in the data points. To eliminate the need for specific call-outs, I opted instead to replace the markers with each vehicle's brand. This allows the viewer to see trends in the data without permanent annotations on each, and if they want to know more about the specific model they can reference the data table or mouse over the data point for the detailed annotation.

# Introduction and Outline

There is so much technological advancement constantly being touted, it is sometimes hard to appreciate the strides modern society has made in certain areas. 
One of those areas is Electric Vehicle technology. When electric vehicles were introduced in earnest around the year 2000, they were relatively unattractive, 
somewhat expensive, and suffered from drawbacks like poor cargo space. In the years since then, the electric vehicle market has grown appreciably but the 
carmaker at the forefront of this charge has commanded a high price point for sporty looking, practical, and technology packed vehicles. This price point has 
deterred many average americans from seriously considering electric vehicles so far. The latest cars to come to market and the continuously improving electric vehicle infrastructure have now made it highly economical and environmentally friendly to own and operate these EV's!

The Story Arc will look a bit something like this...

When EV's were first re-introduced in earnest (around 2000) they were unattractive, somewhat impractical, and had some serious drawbacks due to the large space taken up by the batteries. In addition, the first really good EV's were cost prohibitive to most regular people. With these factors influencing buyers, many opted to go with conventional vehicles because they were familiar, and also because oftentimes the electricity used to charge the EV's involved burning fossil fuels anyways so the environmental benefit was small. 

As time progressed however, battery technology improved, renewable resources began to comprise a larger portion of the electricity generated for the power grid, and EV's became more trendy and stylish. With these changes, it is more attractive than ever to purchase an EV for a daily driver. The call to action here would be to encourage people who wouldn't normally consider EV's  to look deeper at them before the next time they shop for a car. 

The target users here can be summed up with the following two user statements:
1) I want to be informed about green technology in order to make a positive difference in the levels of global pollution.

2) I want to be informed about the latest technology in order to be an early adopter of the latest and greatest. 

The medium I intend to use for this presentation is Shorthand. This program appears to be a somewhat simple, yet powerful tool that will allow me to produce a high quality web-based presentation that can integrate all of the charts and media I hope to utilize. The media I plan to embed will include a timeline as well as some other charts that will probably consist of line and bar charts, but that is still yet to be determined!

# Data

the Tesla roadster was released in 2008 as the first highway legal, modern Li-ion battery all EV. It costed between $80,000 and $120,000 relative to the [average gas car MSRP after options being $30,400](/https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/22/car-prices-are-rapidly-increasing-heres-why-thats-bad-for-americans.html#:~:text=Back%20in%202008%2C%20the%20average,car's%20overall%20price%20to%20%2430%2C400.) 

Next, I'd call out the other most popular electric vehicles to be released around that time (Volt, 2011, $40,280 [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Volt) and Leaf, 2010, $25,000 [motortrend](https://www.motortrend.com/news/2010-nissan-leaf-first-look/))

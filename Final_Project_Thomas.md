# Introduction and Outline

There is so much technological advancement constantly being touted, it is sometimes hard to appreciate the strides modern society has made in certain areas. 
One of those areas is Electric Vehicle technology. When electric vehicles were introduced in earnest around the year 2000, they were relatively unattractive, 
somewhat expensive, and suffered from drawbacks like poor cargo space. In the years since then, the electric vehicle market has grown appreciably but the 
carmaker at the forefront of this charge has commanded a high price point for sporty looking, practical, and technology packed vehicles. This price point has 
deterred many average americans from seriously considering electric vehicles so far. The latest cars to come to market and the continuously improving electric vehicle infrastructure have now made it highly economical and environmentally friendly to own and operate these EV's!

The Story Arc will look a bit something like this...

When EV's were first re-introduced in earnest (around 2000) they were unattractive, somewhat impractical, and had some serious drawbacks due to the large space taken up by the batteries. In addition, the first really good EV's were cost prohibitive to most regular people. With these factors influencing buyers, many opted to go with conventional vehicles because they were familiar, and also because oftentimes the electricity used to charge the EV's involved burning fossil fuels anyways so the environmental benefit was small. 

As time progressed however, battery technology improved, renewable resources began to comprise a larger portion of the electricity generated for the power grid, and EV's became more trendy and stylish. With these changes, it is more attractive than ever to purchase an EV for a daily driver. The call to action here would be to encourage people who wouldn't normally consider EV's  to look deeper at them before the next time they shop for a car. 

The target users here can be summed up with the following two user statements:
1) I want to be informed about green technology in order to make a positive difference in the levels of global pollution.

2) I want to be informed about the latest technology in order to be an early adopter of the latest and greatest. 

The medium I intend to use for this presentation is Shorthand. This program appears to be a somewhat simple, yet powerful tool that will allow me to produce a high quality web-based presentation that can integrate all of the charts and media I hope to utilize. The media I plan to embed will include a timeline as well as some other charts that will probably consist of line and bar charts, but that is still yet to be determined!

# Data

the Tesla roadster was released in 2008 as the first highway legal, modern Li-ion battery all EV. [It costed between $80,000 and $120,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster_(2008)) relative to the [average gas car MSRP after options being $30,400](/https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/22/car-prices-are-rapidly-increasing-heres-why-thats-bad-for-americans.html#:~:text=Back%20in%202008%2C%20the%20average,car's%20overall%20price%20to%20%2430%2C400.) 

Next, I'd call out the other most popular plug-in electric vehicles to be released in the first few years (2008-2012)

Chevy Volt: $40,280

Nissan Leaf: $25,000

Prius: $32,000

Model S: $57,400

Ford C-Max: $26,000

The data gained from these sources will allow me to put into perspective the relative costs and electric range possible at the various price points for these electric cars. I intend the data to show that the pure electric car plays with practical range were either cost prohibitive or the Nissan Leaf... though one could make the case that the Leaf didn't have very practical mileage for anything but a short commute with just 73 miles of range. 

The chart I intend to make might look something like this:

I then want to talk about the inherent benefits in energy efficiency of electric over gasoline engines. Gasoline engines only have an efficiency of about 20-25%, meaning 75%-80% of the energy contained in the fuel is actually lost in heat, friction, and powering other components of the vehicle. For electric vehicles, the base efficiency is on the order of 60%, and with the use of regenerative braking this efficiency can reach as high as 77%. This means that the amount of energy etracted from whatever fuel was used goes 2-3 times further for electric cars!
I'd also like to work in the cost per mile for fuel with gas or electric vehicles, and that will be looked into with my surveys. 

This chart will likely look something like this.

Next, I intend to talk about how power generation at the turn of the century was largely non-renewable so many people made the argument that even electric cars create more greenhouse gasses when the electricity is generated to power them. While this was true in years past, things have changed somewhat since then. I want to show a time series chart, probably a bar chart or a line plot showing how renewable energy adoption has grown between 2000 and 2020. 

Once I cover this, I will turn to the highest growth renewable - solar. This product is being increasingly adopted, and because of that prices are falling and technology is improving. While not all of these savings are passed directly to residential consumers, the impacts are being felt somewhat. The chart will look like this.

Finally, I want to return to the original chart, but this time with an extension that goes past 2012 all the way to 2020. In this chart my intent will be to draw the viewer's eye to the fact that higher range cars are now coming at a lower price point that is more accessible to the everyday consumer. 


# Wireframes
The initial wireframe for my project shows how I intend to lay out the data. I plan to be very logical and take the audience through one point at a time to drive the points I am trying to make home with the benefit of context from previous points at each step.

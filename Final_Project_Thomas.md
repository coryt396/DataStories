# Introduction and Outline

There is so much technological advancement constantly being touted, it is sometimes hard to appreciate the strides modern society has made in certain areas. 
One of those areas is Electric Vehicle technology. When electric vehicles were introduced in earnest around the year 2000, they were relatively unattractive, 
somewhat expensive, and suffered from drawbacks like poor cargo space. In the years since then, the electric vehicle market has grown appreciably but the 
carmaker at the forefront of this charge has commanded a high price point for sporty looking, practical, and technology packed vehicles. This price point has 
deterred many average americans from seriously considering electric vehicles so far. The latest cars to come to market and the continuously improving electric vehicle infrastructure have now made it highly economical and environmentally friendly to own and operate these EV's!

The Story Arc will look a bit something like this...

![Story Arc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67769481/88490294-ac26e500-cf68-11ea-9194-4af4e4558856.png)

When EV's were first re-introduced in earnest (around 2000) they were unattractive, somewhat impractical, and had some serious drawbacks due to the large space taken up by the batteries. In addition, the first really good EV's were cost prohibitive to most regular people. With these factors influencing buyers, many opted to go with conventional vehicles because they were familiar, and also because oftentimes the electricity used to charge the EV's involved burning fossil fuels anyways so the environmental benefit was small. 

As time progressed however, battery technology improved, renewable resources began to comprise a larger portion of the electricity generated for the power grid, and EV's became more trendy and stylish. With these changes, it is more attractive than ever to purchase an EV for a daily driver. The call to action here would be to encourage people who wouldn't normally consider EV's  to look deeper at them before the next time they shop for a car. 

The target users here can be summed up with the following two user statements:
1) I want to be informed about green technology in order to make a positive difference in the levels of global pollution.

2) I want to be informed about the latest technology in order to be an early adopter of the latest and greatest. 

The medium I intend to use for this presentation is Shorthand. This program appears to be a somewhat simple, yet powerful tool that will allow me to produce a high quality web-based presentation that can integrate all of the charts and media I hope to utilize. The media I plan to embed will include a timeline as well as some other charts that will probably consist of line and bar charts, but that is still yet to be determined!

# Data

the Tesla roadster was released in 2008 as the first highway legal, modern Li-ion battery all EV. [It costed between $80,000 and $120,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster_(2008)) relative to the [average gas car MSRP after options being $30,400](/https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/22/car-prices-are-rapidly-increasing-heres-why-thats-bad-for-americans.html#:~:text=Back%20in%202008%2C%20the%20average,car's%20overall%20price%20to%20%2430%2C400.) 

Next, I'd call out the other most popular plug-in electric vehicles to be released in the first few years (2008-2012) 
Vehicle sales source: https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10567

Chevy Volt: $40,280 
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Volt)
Nissan Leaf: $25,000 
[motortrend](https://www.motortrend.com/news/2010-nissan-leaf-first-look/))

Prius: $32,000
https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/reviews/2012-toyota-prius-plug-in-review/

Model S: $57,400
https://www.autotrader.com/tesla/model-s/2012

Ford C-Max: $26,000
https://www.hybridcars.com/ford-c-max-hybrid/

The data gained from these sources will allow me to put into perspective the relative costs and electric range possible at the various price points for these electric cars. I intend the data to show that the pure electric car plays with practical range were either cost prohibitive or the Nissan Leaf... though one could make the case that the Leaf didn't have very practical mileage for anything but a short commute with just 73 miles of range. 

The chart I intend to make might look something like this:

I then want to talk about the inherent benefits in energy efficiency of electric over gasoline engines. Gasoline engines only have an efficiency of about 20-25%, meaning 75%-80% of the energy contained in the fuel is actually lost in heat, friction, and powering other components of the vehicle. For electric vehicles, the base efficiency is on the order of 60%, and with the use of regenerative braking this efficiency can reach as high as 77%. This means that the amount of energy etracted from whatever fuel was used goes 2-3 times further for electric cars!
I'd also like to work in the cost per mile for fuel with gas or electric vehicles, and that will be looked into with my surveys. 

This chart will likely look something like this.

Next, I intend to talk about how power generation at the turn of the century was less renewable so many people made the argument that even electric cars create more greenhouse gasses when the electricity is generated to power them. While this was true in years past, things have changed somewhat since then. I want to show a time series chart, probably a bar chart or a line plot showing how renewable energy adoption has grown between 2000 and 2020.

Once I cover this, I will turn to the highest growth renewable - solar. This product is being increasingly adopted, and because of that prices are falling and technology is improving. While not all of these savings are passed directly to residential consumers, the impacts are being felt somewhat. The chart will look like this.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67769481/88746547-cd2f3780-d11a-11ea-8acd-afb60d752d5c.png)

Finally, I want to return to the original chart, but this time with an extension that goes past 2012 all the way to 2020. In this chart my intent will be to draw the viewer's eye to the fact that higher range cars are now coming at a lower price point that is more accessible to the everyday consumer.

# Wireframes
The initial wireframe for my project shows how I intend to lay out the data. I plan to be very logical and take the audience through one point at a time to drive the points I am trying to make home with the benefit of context from previous points at each step. 

![New Wireframe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67769481/88877638-fe2f6b00-d1f3-11ea-99a6-ccb8c56afb4f.png)

# User feedback 


  For my story, I hope to reach a target audience who is both willing to try new technology and who is looking to help in the initiative to minimize our carbon footprint. The most wealthy and dedicated early adopters and environmentalists are likely to have already joined the EV movement, but those who did not previously have the financial means to purchase the best EV's and more casual environmentalists may not have made the switch yet. These people are who I am looking to reach with this information. With the latest information provided and their previous inclination to adopt this sort of technology, I am confident that they will be convinced to at least consider an EV as their next car purchase.  
  
  For my interviewees, I chose from my close friends and picked a sub-section who are located across the spectrum of likelihood to become convinced to buy an EV. My brother is mechanically inclined, and currently owns a muscle car - quite the opposite of an EV. I don't think he'll be very willing to consider an EV because of his affinity for traditional automotive design and performance. While one could make the case that the performance of the latest EV's are impressive as well, I am sticking to the renewable energy and affordable nature of EV's as my main selling points. Another friend of mine is pretty ambivalent about cars. He owns a subaru and likes it well enough, but he's definitely not a car guy. He will probably be a wild card and could go either way. Lastly, I plan to interview my wife who I think will be very open to the idea. She is environmentally conscious, and also is as frugal as me. I would be willing to bet that she is very open to the idea of an EV as our next car after I make my case. 
  For my interview, I plan to use the following script:
  "Based on this Wireframe, What do you believe the message is that I'm trying to convey?"
  
  "Does the wireframe I showed you align well with this message within this story arc? If not, how could I improve it?"
  
  "Looking at sketch #1, what do you first notice about the chart? What do you notice after more time, and what would you then change?"

  "Looking at sketch #2, what do you first notice about the chart? What do you notice after more time, and what would you then change?"

  "Looking at sketch #3, what do you first notice about the chart? What do you notice after more time, and what would you then change?"

  
 Upon conducting my interviews, these are the responses I received:
### "Based on this Wireframe, What do you believe the message is that I'm trying to convey?"
 Blaise: "Is the takeaway here that alternative energy is on the rise? I see you're talking about solar costs too, why is that specifically called out?"
 
 Steve: "If I had to guess, you're trying to convey that Electric vehicles are better than gas vehicles."
 
 Lizzie: "I think you're trying to show how technology is improving and how it enables us to contribute to a more renewable future."
 
 ### Does the wireframe I showed you align well with this message within the story arc? If not, how could I improve it?"
 Blaise: "Yeah, now that I see this story arc, things actually got a little more clear. I see how the progression was supposed to go. I'd say they align well enough that with full context I think they're doing the job they are supposed to"
 
 Steve: "Looking at this, I think that there was a little more to this than I originally was focused on. The charts on the wireframe are a bit generic and it's a bit tough to separate one section from another when the images are the same. If you've got actual sketches though, that may help. "
 
 Lizzie: "I think the wireframe definitely aligns well with the story arc. You're showing how EV technology has evolved since its introduction, and that's especially clear with the added information of the story arc. I don't really see much you should do to improve them, but I'd say you'd definitely want to show them together to get the full benefit. "
 
 ### "Looking at sketch #1, what do you first notice about the chart? What do you notice after more time, and what would you then change?"
 
 Blaise: "I see the different size dots first. The size difference is very noticeable, but I don't see anything clearly stated here that tells me what the size means. Is that number sold? After more time I'd probably suggest you work on a more engaging title for the chart. This one doesn't really inspire much."
 
 Steve: "First thing I see is the title. Price & Utility of Early EV's. This chart is probably something showing price versus some metric, maybe performance, maybe range, maybe cargo space for these cars... After a little longer I'd say I'm getting the idea that the bubble size means something but I can't really figure out what it is. There are numbers next to each bubble but no explanation. I'd definitely fix that in the next iteration. 
 
 Lizzie: "When I first look at this, I see the dots. My eye is drawn to the shapes, and then I begin to read the text next to each. I'm not sure what the text is telling me, so the next place I look would be the axes. The axes show me a progression in time as well as the price of the cars. I'm not seeing any explanation of the dot size though, so that's something I'd address for sure. "
 
  ### "Looking at sketch #2, what do you first notice about the chart? What do you notice after more time, and what would you then change?"

  Blaise: "The first thing I see here is the legend. I'm drawn to the cluster of color and I want to see what I'm going to be looking at. As soon as I get my bearings with that, I'm focused on the chart itself. I see that power to the wheels is much higher for EV's relative to gas. That's actually very interesting. One thing I'd probably change though is that the colors are a bit bright. It's harder for me to distinguish what's going on here through all of that brightness."
  
  Steve: "The first thing I notice when looking at this is that there isn't a title. I generatlly start at the top, so next I'm looking at the legend to get an idea of what the chart is telling me. I see a couple different descriptions of energy losses, and the y axis confirms this. I would definitely add a title to provide quick context for this chart."
  
  Lizzie: " Looking at this chart, I see two bars of very bright colors. It seems to be a stacked bar chart, so they are comparing composition of two things. Looking at the x axis, we're comparing electric and gas cars. Taking a step back to read the legend and the y axis, I now understand that this is showing how much more efficiently electric cars use their energy. This is a pretty strong case in itself for the benefits of EV's. I'd be curious though how the costs of these energy sources differ. Is electric cheaper to run as well?"
  
  ### "Looking at sketch #3, what do you first notice about the chart? What do you notice after more time, and what would you then change?"

Blaise: "This last sketch looks to me like a line chart. My eye is immediately drawn to the line itself, which has a steep downward slope. Next place my eye wanders is the y axis to see what is dropping so fast. It't pretty impressive how much the cost of photovoltaics have dropped, but I'm not sure right off the bat how this fits into all of this. I'd make sure you explain that when giving the presentation."

Steve: "When I first look at this sketch, I see the title "US Solar PV Price Declies". This does a pretty good job at explaining what the chart shows but this could probably be improved. This is a pretty simple graph, and there may be some benefit to tying this to another idea to make sure it is providing as much information as possible. "

Lizzie: "When I look at this image, I see a sharp downward slope in the cost of photovoltaics. I'm actually surprised at how quickly this is falling, but I wonder if that actually translates to install cost for single family homes where EV's would get the most benefit from solar. This might be something good to look into."

  ### Review of Interviews
  
  The takeaways from these conversations definitely varied, and the diverse perspectives helped get me some different ideas as well. For the first question, I recieved 3 different answers, and I think some of the ambiguity in the results from my storyboard is because I used the stock charts which look very similar to each other. I will probably try to integrate snapshots of my sketches to provide some different images that give better context. 
  
  For the second question, I had much of the same type of feedback specifically calling out that the story arc and the wireframe go hand in hand. I think it would be worthwhile to find a way to integrate more of the specific quotes from the story arc to the wireframe. It will likely help to better connect the two and make clear the takeaways from the presentation. For this reason, I went back and integrated sketches into my wireframe.
    
   The third question was about sketch #1. This sketch showed the array of price vs. release year and range for the 5 most popular EV's in 2012. Nearly every person mentioned that the size of the bubbles was not clearly defined, so I'll need to make sure I have a legend in the next draft. In addition, I think it would be helpful to call out that these were the 5 most popular EV's in that timeframe. While it wasn't specifically called out by anyone, looking back that would provide some more context for why these are relevant. I thought the title was fairly clear, but based on the feedback the viewer may value a more catchy title over one that is simply practical. That's another thing I'll probably improve for next time. 
   
   The fourth question was regarding sketch #2. This sketch showed the energy efficiency of gas vs. electric motors. Color was called out here as being to bright and intense. While I wasn't making detailed choices for color in the sketches, I'll be sure to avoid colors with too much brightness in the next draft. Another thing brought up was the lack of title. In some cases, I simply rely on the axes to tell the story, but from this feedback I'd say this chart isn't one that has axes that stand on their own. I'll need to come up with a relevant and catchy title for this next version. Lastly, a really interesting point was raised about the relative operating cost of the two types of vehicles. This could be a good opportunity for a composite chart with two separate axes showing that relation as well as the breakdown of energy usage. 
   
   The final question was regarding sketch #3. This sketch was a line chart showing the decline in solar PV price.It wasn't immediately clear to some interviewees how this fit into everything to do with cars, so I'll need to make sure I address that either with another figure or just in discussion during my presentation. Another suggesion here was to create a composite chart for this as it is a very simple chart. With tihs suggesion, I coupled this with the growth in solar energy adoption for power generation in the US. This turned out to be a really good opportunity to put two simple charts together to one more robust point. Lastly, It was brought up that these prices may not directly translate to the price consumers pay in residential installations. I want to do some more digging at this source to see if I can find some figures or information to support or refute this idea. That would be a very important caveat if found to not translate to residential installs. At the very least that distinction would need to be called out somewhere on the figure.

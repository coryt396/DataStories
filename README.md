Welcome to my portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About Me

I'm a part time graduate student in the Engineering and Technology Innovation Management program at CMU. My undergraduate degree is in Chemical Engineering, and I have since spent about 5 years in industry where I've worked for chemical companies in manufacturing operations and process automation. I currently work for PPG Industries in a group that is tasked with developing analytical technology to streamline and optimize the way things are done in manufacturing settings. In the future, I am interesting in leveraging my technical background and the skills learned in attaining this advanced degree to serve the company in a technical leadership role. 

# What I hope to learn

While I already have a strong affinity for graphs and charts, I sometimes have the tendency to overcomplicate them in order to convey a complicated message. In this course I hope to learn how to make more eye catching, concise, and effective illustrations of the data and goals of my projects. This skill would be invaluable in  both in my current job and every job in my future!

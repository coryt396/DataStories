# Government Debt Levels are Dangerously High in Some Countries

Below you will find a figure describing the debt burdens of numerous countries as of 2018. The OECD publishes these numbers to serve as key indicators for the sustainability of a government's financial system.

## Time progression of Government Debt

Another way to visualize this concept is through a simple line chart that shows the progression of each country's debt to GDP ratio in time. While it is not true in all cases, countries with debt that is in excess of GDP are susceptible to greater risk from global destabilizing events.

## Comparative Review of Government Debt Levels and Growth Rates 

There is also benefit to revewing year to year variation in this financial stability measure for global economies on a more comparative basis. This visualization can be achieved by constructing a bubble chart as shown below. This interactive chart spans from the year 1995 to 2019 for most countries, while some countries have reported only a sub-set of data for that time period. The black timeline at the top of the chart can be moved either by clicking and dragging the dot or by clicking the play/pause button which will begin the progression of the chart through the years of data provided. As noted previously, countries with a higher debt load relative to GDP - specifically when the ratio is greater than 1 - are at significantly greater risk to financial distress in the event of a global destabilization. This relationship is highlighted with the choice of colors here, showing the relative risk of each country's financial system. The size of the bubbles on the chart are set based on the compound annual growth rate of each country's debt relative to GDP for the 10 years leading up to 2018 (where data is available).Specifically, this chart shows very well how much the debt landscape changes and grows  in the years following the financial crisis of 2008. In addition, I thought that it was ver interesting to see that some countries that are still relatiely low in debt to GDP ratio posess the highest compound annual growth rate.

## Summary

While all of these visualization methods are valid and serve a purpose, each one has specific strengths and weaknesses. The original bar chart is highly simplistic and quickly highlights the countries with the highest debt load in 2018. This is where the greatest weakness of this chart comes to light however. It only provides information at one point in time. The array of line plots however shows a time progression of this debt burden to GDP ratio. The shape of these plots quickly allows the viewer to recognize which countries have the greatest debt burdens as well as which countries have grown the debt most quickly. The downside of this chart type is that it is very difficult to compare the specific charts of one country to another at a given time because they are not overlaid on the same axes. The chart chosen to provide all of this information was the bubble plot. This plot was integrated with a time variable which allows the user to scan through the duration of the data set to look at trends for each year as well as overall. In addition, the size of the bubbles is based on the compound annual growth rate of each country so once the user realizes this, they can quickly assess which countries exhibited the greatest debt growth in the years leading up to 2018.

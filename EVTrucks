During my studies, I stumbled across an article outlining the global EV outlook for 2019. In this article posted on the International Energy Agency website, 
one of the figures included in the article regarded EV trucks that are currently on the market and also showed those that are soon to arrive. To me, this is
a very interesting topic, as not many of these trucks are on the road yet even though they have the potential to really transform the industry. By changing 
even a fraction of the energy required for ground freight to renewable sources, the world could make a measurable impact to better our environment.
